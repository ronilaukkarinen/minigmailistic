# Gmail + Minimalistic = Minigmailistic

Clever, huh? As I started using Gmail web view as my main email "app" in 2023, I decided to clean it up a bit. Here's my opinionated styles.

## Installation

1. Install [live-css-editor](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor) (or any other extension that allows you to inject CSS into web pages, I find the mentioned the most minimal approach)
2. Get style.css from this repo
3. Open extension and paste the CSS into the editor
4. Clic PIN icon so the styles will be remembered for the domain
